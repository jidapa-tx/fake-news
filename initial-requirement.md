### Functional Requirements

| ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria (AC) |
| -- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| **FR.1** | **Access & Privacy** | |
| FR.1.1 | As a user, I want to access the web application without authentication, so I can verify news immediately without friction. | 1. The application loads instantly without login screen or required credentials. 2. No personal data is collected at any point. |
| FR.1.2 | As a user, I want my check history stored locally in my browser, so my privacy is protected. | 1. All history records are persisted in `localStorage` (web) or `chrome.storage.local` (extension). 2. A visible banner displays "🔒 ข้อมูลเก็บในเครื่องคุณเท่านั้น ไม่ส่งไป server". 3. No history is transmitted to any backend. |
| FR.1.3 | As a user, I want to clear my local history at any time, so I can control my data. | 1. A "Clear all history" button exists on the History page with confirmation dialog. 2. Individual records can be deleted with a trash icon. 3. After clearing, localStorage for history key is completely removed. |
| **FR.2** | **News Content Analysis** | |
| FR.2.1 | As a user, I want to paste text, URL, or upload an image to verify news, so I can check any format of content. | 1. Home page has a single large input area with 3 toggle tabs: Text / URL / Image. 2. Text tab accepts up to 5000 characters. 3. URL tab validates URL format before submission. 4. Image tab accepts JPG/PNG/WEBP up to 10MB. 5. A primary "ตรวจสอบ" button triggers analysis. |
| FR.2.2 | As a user, I want to see the credibility score as one of 5 clear levels with a percentage, so I can understand verdict at a glance. | 1. Result displays one of 5 levels with matching color: อันตราย (0-20%, red), น่าสงสัย (21-40%, orange), ไม่แน่ใจ (41-60%, yellow), ค่อนข้างจริง (61-80%, lime), ยืนยันแล้ว (81-100%, green). 2. A 5-segment progress bar highlights the current level. 3. Numerical score 0-100 is displayed alongside level label. |
| FR.2.3 | As a user, I want to see the percentage of references that support vs. oppose the claim, so I can weigh the evidence. | 1. Three stat cards display: % supporting sources, % opposing sources, % unchecked. 2. Total reference count is shown (e.g., "19/20 แหล่ง"). 3. Each percentage adds up to 100%. |
| FR.2.4 | As a user, I want to see AI confidence level separately from credibility score, so I know when to be skeptical of the tool itself. | 1. AI confidence shown as separate metric (e.g., "AI confidence: 92%"). 2. If confidence < 60%, display warning "⚠ AI ยังไม่มั่นใจในผลนี้ กรุณาตรวจสอบเพิ่มเติม". |
| FR.2.5 | As a user, I want to see reasoning explained in Thai bullet points, so I understand why this verdict was given. | 1. Result page displays "ทำไมถึงน่าสงสัย" section with 3-7 bullet points in Thai. 2. Each bullet starts with a signal icon (⚠/!/?). 3. Bullets are clickable to expand detailed explanation. |
| **FR.3** | **Reference Management** | |
| FR.3.1 | As a user, I want to see the list of reference sources used to verify the claim, so I can read the originals myself. | 1. Result page includes "แหล่งอ้างอิง" section listing all references. 2. Each reference shows: source name, stance badge (ยืนยัน/คัดค้าน/เป็นกลาง), excerpt (max 200 chars), publication date, credibility badge. 3. Each reference has a clickable link opening in new tab. |
| FR.3.2 | As a user, I want references categorized by credibility of the source, so I can prioritize trusted outlets. | 1. References are sortable by source credibility (default: highest first). 2. Badge colors indicate source tier: TRUSTED_MEDIA (blue), FACT_CHECKER (green), ACADEMIC (purple), GOV (gray). 3. Top-tier sources (credibility ≥ 80) are visually prominent. |
| FR.3.3 | As a user, I want the system to seed with well-known Thai and international sources, so I trust the base dataset. | 1. Database is pre-seeded with minimum 20 trusted sources. 2. Thai sources include: ไทยรัฐ, มติชน, ประชาชาติ, ไทยพีบีเอส, AFP Fact Check TH, ศูนย์ต่อต้านข่าวปลอม, Sure And Share Center, Cofact Thailand. 3. International sources include: BBC, Reuters, AP News, Snopes, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact. |
| **FR.4** | **Source & Account Analyzer** | |
| FR.4.1 | As a user, I want to analyze the domain of a news URL, so I can identify suspicious websites. | 1. When a URL is submitted, the system calls `/api/analyze/source` automatically. 2. Results show: domain age (days), SSL status (valid/invalid/none), WHOIS privacy status, known phishing status. 3. Risk level is displayed as 3 tiers: ปลอดภัย (green), น่าสงสัย (yellow), อันตราย (red). |
| FR.4.2 | As a user, I want to see warnings about suspicious social media accounts that shared this news, so I can spot bot behavior. | 1. If a social media URL is provided, account analysis is triggered. 2. Displayed signals: account age, post frequency, follower/following ratio, coordinated posting detection. 3. For MVP, social account analysis returns mock data with clear "(MVP: mock data)" label. |
| FR.4.3 | As a user, I want to see if multiple accounts posted the same content simultaneously, so I can detect information operations. | 1. Coordinated behavior detection flags cases where 5+ accounts posted identical text within 30-minute window. 2. If detected, display badge "⚠ พบเครือข่าย [N] บัญชี โพสต์ข้อความเดียวกัน". 3. For MVP, this feature uses seeded demo data. |
| **FR.5** | **AI-Generated Image Detection** | |
| FR.5.1 | As a user, I want to upload an image and know if it was generated by AI, so I can identify fake visual content. | 1. Image upload triggers `/api/analyze/image`. 2. Result displays: AI probability (0-100%), detected model (Midjourney/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion/unknown), signal list in Thai. 3. For MVP, detection uses heuristics (EXIF metadata check, file pattern analysis) with clear comment in code marking placeholder for future ML model integration. |
| FR.5.2 | As a user, I want to see the image metadata analysis, so I can verify authenticity manually. | 1. Metadata section displays: EXIF presence, dimensions, file format, file size. 2. Missing EXIF is flagged as suspicious signal. 3. Unusual dimensions (e.g., 1024x1024 square) are noted as potential AI indicator. |
| FR.5.3 | As a user, I want to see if the image appeared elsewhere online before, so I can detect recycled misleading images. | 1. Reverse image search returns: first seen date, number of appearances, top matching URLs. 2. For MVP, returns mock data with "(MVP: reverse search placeholder)" label. 3. UI is built to accept real API response format for future integration. |
| **FR.6** | **Trending Searches** | |
| FR.6.1 | As a user, I want to see which news items are being checked most today, so I can stay aware of trending misinformation. | 1. `/trending` page displays top 20 most-checked queries. 2. Each entry shows: rank, query text, check count, % change from previous period, verdict badge. 3. Period selector: วันนี้ / สัปดาห์นี้ / เดือนนี้. |
| FR.6.2 | As a user, I want trending data to be anonymized, so my privacy is protected. | 1. No IP addresses, user agents, or personal data are stored with trending counts. 2. Only query text (hashed for similar detection) and verdict are aggregated. 3. Privacy notice on trending page: "ข้อมูลเป็นสถิติรวม ไม่มีการเก็บข้อมูลผู้ใช้". |
| FR.6.3 | As a user, I want trending entries to be clickable to see full results, so I can learn from others' verifications. | 1. Clicking a trending entry opens the cached result page. 2. Result page shows "ตรวจครั้งล่าสุด: [timestamp]". 3. User can re-verify with "ตรวจสอบอีกครั้ง" button. |
| **FR.7** | **Local History** | |
| FR.7.1 | As a user, I want to see my past verification history in the browser, so I can revisit previous checks. | 1. `/history` page displays list of past checks from localStorage. 2. Each entry shows: query preview (truncated), verdict badge, timestamp (relative: "2 ชม.ที่แล้ว"). 3. Maximum 100 entries stored; oldest auto-removed when limit exceeded. |
| FR.7.2 | As a user, I want to search and filter my local history, so I can quickly find past checks. | 1. Search input filters by query text (substring match). 2. Filter dropdown filters by verdict level (อันตราย/น่าสงสัย/ไม่แน่ใจ/ค่อนข้างจริง/ยืนยันแล้ว/ทั้งหมด). 3. Date range filter: today / this week / this month / all time. |
| FR.7.3 | As a user, I want to export my history as JSON, so I can backup or share it. | 1. "Export JSON" button downloads a `.json` file with all history entries. 2. File structure: `{ version: "1.0", exported_at: ISO date, items: HistoryItem[] }`. 3. "Import JSON" accepts the same format and merges with existing history (no duplicates). |
| **FR.8** | **Chrome Extension** | |
| FR.8.1 | As a user browsing Facebook/X/LINE Today, I want to see credibility badges on posts automatically, so I am warned in real-time. | 1. Extension uses Manifest V3 with content scripts for facebook.com, x.com, twitter.com, today.line.me. 2. Badge appears near post text showing level color and text (e.g., "🔴 ข่าวปลอม" / "🟢 ยืนยันแล้ว"). 3. Badges only appear when confidence ≥ 70%, otherwise hidden to avoid false alarms. |
| FR.8.2 | As a user, I want to click a badge to see full analysis details, so I can read the evidence. | 1. Clicking badge opens the extension popup with detailed breakdown. 2. Popup contains: verdict, reference list (top 3), link to full result on web app. 3. Popup is responsive at 360x600 size. |
| FR.8.3 | As a user, I want to manually paste content into the extension popup, so I can check ad-hoc text. | 1. Extension popup icon click opens input UI. 2. Input accepts text or URL. 3. Results display inline in popup without opening new tab. |
| FR.8.4 | As a user, I want to control which sites the extension runs on, so I can manage privacy and performance. | 1. Settings page within popup allows per-site toggle (facebook.com, x.com, today.line.me). 2. Global on/off switch is accessible from popup header. 3. Settings persist in `chrome.storage.local`. |
| FR.8.5 | As a user, I want extension API calls to be cached, so I don't wait for repeated checks. | 1. Results cached in `chrome.storage.local` with content hash as key. 2. Cache TTL: 1 hour for fresh content, 24 hours for known fake claims. 3. Cache is cleared when user clicks "Refresh" on a badge. |
